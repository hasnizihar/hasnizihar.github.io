Build a modern AI-powered Weather Analysis & Summary website using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and Python (FastAPI recommended) for the backend. The site must allow users to get weather by GPS location or city search, fetch forecast data from the free Open-Meteo API, extract compact weather “facts” (current temperature, wind, humidity, next 24h rain totals, peak wind, 7-day highs/lows), compute risk badges (rain/wind/heat levels), impact scores (outdoor, travel, comfort), and best-time windows for outdoor activity. Then send only the structured facts (not raw arrays) into an LLM API to generate a strict JSON-only response containing a short human-style summary, today/24h/7d insights, risks, recommendations, activity-based advice, and confidence score. Include an “Ask the Weather” question box powered by the same forecast facts. The UI must be clean, responsive, and dashboard-style with cards, badges, charts, loading/error states, saved locations via localStorage, unit toggle, and an explainability toggle showing key metrics used. Implement caching and rate limiting in the backend, provide fallback rule-based summaries if the LLM fails, and ensure all personal API keys (LLM key, model name, provider) are stored only in a local secrets.txt file (ignored by git) and never exposed in frontend code. The agent must deliver complete working project files: index.html, styles.css, app.js, server.py, config reader, weather fetch module, compute module, llm module, README with run steps, and must follow the JSON contracts strictly for all endpoints and AI outputs.
