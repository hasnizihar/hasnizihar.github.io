        overview: [
            'This project involved the conceptual planning and 3D visualization of a community green space aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and public engagement.',
            'The objective was to develop a simple yet functional spatial layout that could be used as a reference for implementation.',
            'The design incorporated landscaped walkways, shaded seating areas, and tree-lined corridors to create a calm, welcoming, and environmentally responsible public space. Special attention was given to pedestrian comfort, green integration, and practical site utilization within a limited conceptual modeling platform.',
        ],
        objectives: [
            'Develop a functional and visually appealing community green space',
            'Promote sustainable landscaping and environmental awareness',
            'Create comfortable shaded pedestrian pathways',
            'Encourage social interaction through public seating areas',
            'Provide a practical conceptual model for real-world implementation'
        ],
        challenges: 'The primary challenge was working within the limitations of lightweight modeling software while still producing a clear and meaningful spatial representation. Additionally, the design needed to balance aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability within a conceptual-level framework without detailed engineering inputs.',
        solution: 'Using Sweet Home 3D, a structured layout was developed featuring: Tree-lined pedestrian pathways for natural shading Distributed seating arrangements to promote community interaction Defined circulation zones for accessibility Organized landscaping elements to enhance environmental value Despite being a conceptual model, the layout clearly communicated spatial planning principles and sustainable design intent.'
